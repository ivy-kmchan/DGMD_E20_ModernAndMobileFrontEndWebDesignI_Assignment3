			<p><a href="#"><img src="img/rsz_tokyo.jpg" alt="Tokyo_Photo1" id="Tokyo_Photo1" class="photoFloatRight"></a></p>
			<p>Tokyo is the capital and the largest city of Japan. 
			The city is super busy, and yet very beautiful and clean. The city is full of tall skyscrapers and the people in Tokyo are always in hustle and bustle. The people speak Japanese and they don't speak English very well. When you walk on the street, you always feel like you walk too slow. The transportation system is exceptionally advanced and the trains can bring you to almost every corner of the city.The streets are unbelieveable clean all the times. The Japanese food is good and the people there are nice. Tokyo is very fun to visit and you don't want to miss it! </p>

			It is the cultural, political and economical center of the country.

			<p><a href="#"><img src="img/rsz_seoul.jpg" alt="Seoul_Photo1" id="Seoul_Photo1" class="photoFloatRight"></a></p>
			<p>Seoul is the capital of South Korea. 
			It is the political and economical hub of the country. The city is full of high skyscrapers and traditional Korean houses. Just like Tokyo and Taipei, it has an extremely dense and advanced transportation system. There are a variety choice of food in Seoul, and I love Korean kimchee! The people in Korea speak Korean, and they don't underand English very much. The food are very special and the people are helpful. Seoul is a very unique city and I hope I will go there again soon! </p>
