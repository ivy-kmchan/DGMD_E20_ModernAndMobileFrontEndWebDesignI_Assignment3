			<p>We LOVE Travel!</p>
			<p>My husband and I love to bring our kids to places. We want them to go see the big world, so they know that there are many people living in many different places. We want them to realize and respect other people by going to countries and experiencing the distinct cultures.</p>
			<p>In the last few years, we went to some Asian cities including Tokyo in Japan, Taipei in Taiwan, and Seoul in Korea. People in each of these countries speak different languages, have special living habits, believe in different religions, etc. We visited different places and we want the kids to understand that there is no better or worse; they are just different.</p>
			<p>In this website, I want to show you the countries that we visited. All of these cities have the extremely convenient transporation systems, and tourists like us can go visit many sightseeing points by taking buses, taxis and trains. The city plannings are very unique; they are full of skyscrapers as well as the traditional architectures. Besides, the food in these places are very yummy too. We want to show you what we saw, what we ate, and what we came across.</p>
			<p>Check out the website and let us know if you have any questions. If you like to get the itinerary of any of these trips, just simply fill out the form in "Contact", and I can send you a copy for your future trip planning.</p>
			<p>You can also create your own postcard. Please check out the "Fun" link and create your own!</p>
			<p>Have FUN Travel!</p>
